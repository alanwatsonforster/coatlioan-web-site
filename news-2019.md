## COATLI Closed for the Winter Break

22 December 2019

COATLI has closed for the OAN winter break. Most of the other
telescopes were closed on 14 December, but for the first time DDOTI,
COATLI, and SAINT-EX stayed open longer under the care of a skeleton
crew. We thank Ilse Plauchu and Rosa Becerra for technical support in
this period.
