# COATLI: Status

COATLI is currently in commissioning with an [interim instrument](interim-instrument.html) consisting of a CCD with <i>BVRIw</i> filters.

COATLI opens every night that conditions permit and has achieved excellent reliability. 

However, there are two major [problems](telescope.html#problems) with the telescope and mount that severely impact image quality: 

* The mount frequently shows vibrations with an amplitude of typically 10 arcsec, apparently due to an instability in the mount control system. This problem affects about half of all pointings, apparently randomly. The vibrations appear to be stronger and more common in higher winds.  

  The manufacturer will perform on-site tuning at the end of May 2018, and we hope to resolve this problem.
  
* The telescope mirrors were misfigured and deliver 1.4 arcsec FWHM images even in the best conditions. 

  We are awaiting delivery and installation of a second set of mirrors from the manufacturer. We do not yet have a firm date, but we expect the optics to be installed in Fall 2018.

Development of the definitive fast-guiding imager has been suspended until these two problems have been satisfactorily resolved and the telescope is shown to be capable of delivering seeing-limited images.
