# COATLI: Shared Risk Observations

Given the [image quality problems](telescope.html#problems) with the telescope, the CATT has decided that it is premature to offer COATLI through the usual proposal process.

Nevertheless, the COATLI team have permission to offer shared-risk observations. 
If you are interested in using COATLI in its current state, please contact Alan Watson ([alan@astro.unam.mx](mailto:alan@astro.unam.mx)).
