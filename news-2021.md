## New Mirrors and HUITZI f/8 Imager Installed

06 November 2021

Over the last ten days, the COATLI team installed, aligned, and verified the new mirrors and installed the HUITZI f/8 imager.
The initial results are promising, with about &lambda/10; RMS wave-front error at the zenith (mainly spherical aberration) and
about &lambda;/4 RMS wave-front error at 45 degrees of zenith distance (mainly astigmatism and coma).
