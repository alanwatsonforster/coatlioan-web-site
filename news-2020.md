## COATLI Mirrors Removed

26 January 2020

The mirrors of the COATLI telescope have been removed prior to being returned to
the manufacturer for replacement. The telescope has never given images better
than 1.4 arcsec FWHM, and investigations convinced first us and then the
manufacturer that the problem was with the mirror figure.

COATLI will be closed until further notice.
